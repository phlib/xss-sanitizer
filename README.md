PHP XSS sanitizer tool for HTML

## Disclaimer

Use [HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/).

This library was created to try to solve the problem of XSS sanitization without
using a permissive list, since the HTML which is being sanitized may contain
non-standard or unusual syntax (e.g. HTML for emails).

This library is also intended for a limited use case whereby it is assumed that
the sanitized HTML is only going to be displayed in a limited set of supported
browsers (e.g. no need to strip 'vbscript:' code).

## Install

Via Composer

``` bash
$ composer require phlib/xss-sanitizer
```

## Usage

Create a sanitizer and sanitize some input

``` php
$removeBlocks = ['xss'];
$removeAttributtes = ['onwebkittransitionend'];
$sanitizer = new \Phlib\XssSanitizer\Sanitizer($removeBlocks, $removeAttributtes);
$sanitized = $sanitizer->sanitize($htmlInput);

```

## Supported Browsers

This library is intended to prevent XSS vulnerabilities when the resulting HTML is rendered by any of the following browsers:

* Chrome (40+)
* Firefox (40+)
* Safari (8+)
* IE (10, 11)
* Edge
