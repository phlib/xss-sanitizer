PHP XSS sanitizer tool for HTML

## Disclaimer

Use [HTML Purifier](http://htmlpurifier.org/).

This library was created to try to solve the problem of XSS sanitization without using a whitelist, since the HTML which is being sanitized may contain non-standard or unusual syntax (e.g. HTML for emails).

This library is also intended for a limited use case whereby it is assumed that the sanitized HTML is only going to be displayed in a limited set of supported browsers (e.g. no need to strip 'vbscript:' code).

## Installation

Using Composer just run:

```
composer require phlib/xss-sanitizer
```

## Usage

Create a sanitizer and sanitize some input

``` php
$sanitizer = new \Phlib\XssSanitizer\Sanitizer();
$sanitized = $sanitizer->sanitize($html);
```

Or use the static method signature to change that into a one-liner:

```php
$sanitized = \Phlib\XssSanitizer\Sanitizer::clean($html);
```

## Supported Browsers

This library is intended to prevent XSS vulnerabilities when the resulting HTML is rendered by any of the following browsers:

* Chrome (40+)
* Firefox (40+)
* Safari (8+)
* IE (10, 11)
* Edge
